## How to setup Jared.

First: disable mac sleeping in system preferences to prevent the server from
going to sleep.

- unzip jared
- install jared
- enable jared, disable sending messages, enable REST API, disable contacts
- replace ~/Library/Application Support/Jared/config.json with included backup file

That is the minimal setup for jared to start sending messages to the FastAPI Server.

Don't forget to setup the whitelist list!
